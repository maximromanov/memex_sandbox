In the Mughal successor state of Awadh (1722-1856), such mockery grew more pronounced in the wake of growing financial demands from the British East India Company and attempts by eunuchs to alienate property with wills and testamentary bequests. Through examples of verbal derision directed at eunuchs, this essay shows that not only did ideas of normative masculinity serve as a vehicle for Awadh’s rulers to defend their sovereign authority from colonial encroachment, but that notions of normative manhood continued to inform eunuchs’ own self-perception into the nineteenth century.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Shaykh Ṣaḥan was accused of murdering his nephew and, more significantly, of supporting an Arab tribal rebellion against Ottoman authority. Using archival sources and Mandaean oral history, this article analyzes the case of Shaykh Ṣaḥan within the context of state centralization, Ottoman-British rivalry, and the internal conflicts among the Mandaeans. The case is significant because it sheds light on how large-scale transformations affected vulnerable minorities like the Mandaeans, and the way these communities struggled to survive in turbulent times.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Further to it, the dominant paradigm emphasizes cultural differences in the region, whereby any form of cross-cultural encounters was inevitably hampered by various confessional, religious and social borders. As a result, we tend to read every case of cross-cultural encounter between early modern Central Asia and Russia as a metaphor of cultural incommensurability. In the essay, I shall offer a close reading of two 17th-century Muscovite diplomatic missions to Central Asia as test cases with which to make sense of cultural encounters through the lens of individual actors. In doing so, I shall highlight the specific practices and strategies that allowed the diplomatic actors to play key roles as cultural mediators using their language skills, local knowledge and contact networks. In the broader sense, the essay set out to examine how can we problematize cross-cultural encounters between Central Asian principalities such as Khiva and Bukhara on the one hand, and Pre-Petrine Russia on the other: and to consider what we actually mean when we speak of early modern diplomacy in Central Eurasia.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It brings his biography, journeys and intellectual forays together to show how he used the temporal moment of the mid 19th century 'age of revolts', and the spatial connectivity offered by British and Ottoman imperialisms and re-configured them to his own particular interests. Locating Siddiq Hasan in the connected histories of the British and Ottoman Empires, it views his in-house cosmopolitanism as a form of public conduct that was shaped by Islamic learning that cultivated urbane civility as Muslim universalist virtuous conduct. This was a form of cosmopolitanism enabled by imperial networks, informed by pre-colonial webs of interaction between India and West Asia, and deeply rooted in the scriptures. Le présent article souligne le rôle d'un acteur individuel, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan (1832-90), dans la fabrique de l'histoire culturelle et intellectuelle des imperialismes. En croisant sa biographie, ses voyages et ses incursions intellectuelles, cet article montre comment l'auteur utilisa « l'ère des révoltes » , au milieu du XIX e siècle, ainsi que la continuité spatiale offerte par les imperialismes britannique et ottoman, et les remodela en fonction de ses intérêts particuliers. Replacer Siddiq Hasan dans le contexte historique conjoint des Empires britannique et ottoman permet de concevoir le cosmopolitisme qui lui est propre comme une forme de conduite publique, calquée sur une érudition islamique qui regardait la courtoisie raffinée comme une conduite musulmane vertueuse à la portée universelle. Cette forme de cosmopolitisme, rendue possible par les réseaux impériaux, fut alimentée par un lacis d'interactions précoloniales entre l'Inde et l'Asie occidentale, et se voyait profondément enracinée dans les Écritures.},

This essay concludes that opium was not widely used in the first centuries of the Ming dynasty, and, when finally adopted in the sixteenth century, its use was disconnected from the Yuan dynasty medical tradition.

  abstract = {The sixteenth century witnessed the flowering of European literature that claimed to describe the encounter between Western travelers and the indigenous population of the rest of the world. Similarly, some Persianate writings of the same period present a dialogical encounter, not so much with the European other, but with rival Muslim empires. One of the writers in this genre was Ja'far Beg Qazvīnī, sole author of the third part of the Ta'rikh-i alfi (Millennial History), supervised by the Mughal emperor Akbar. In his book, Ja far Beg drew on an unprecedented store of sources from rival courts and treated the Ottomans, Mughals, and Safavids as essentially equal political and cultural units following identical historical trajectories. He also developed one of the earliest Mughal expressions of "Hindustan" encompassing South Asia in its entirety. While most analyses of this outstanding example of dialogical historiography have downplayed its value because of its paucity of new information, the present article will seek instead to demonstrate its significance for its unusual worldview. Le seizième siècle vit la floraison d'une littérature s'attachant à décrire la rencontre entre les voyageurs occidentaux et les populations indigènes du reste du monde. De façon relativement similaire, les productions culturelles persanisées de la même période font apparaître un certain nombre d'auteurs qui s'engagèrent dans une rencontre dialogique avec des empires musulmans rivaux. Parmi eux se trouve Ja'far Beg Qazvīnī, seul auteur de la troisième partie de la Ta'rïkh-i alfi (Histoire d'un millénaire) supervisée par l'empereur moghol Akbar. Dans cet ouvrage, Ja'far Beg Qazvīnī puisa à un éventail sans précédent de sources persanes et turques issues de cours rivales et traita les Ottomans, Moghols et Safavides comme des unités politiques et culturelles essentiellement équivalentes et aux trajectoires historiques identiques. Il formula également une des expressions mogholes les plus précoces d'un « Hindustan » englobant l'ensemble de l'Asie du Sud. Tandis que la plupart des analyses de cet exceptionnel spécimen d'historiographie dialogique a minimisé sa valeur en raison du peu d'informations factuelles nouvelles qu'il apportait, la présente contribution s'attachera à l'inverse à démontrer l'importance de l'inhabituelle vision du monde qui y est développée.},

The article uses prostitution as a case study to investigate the relationships between the different genres of legal writing and between normative law and legal practice. It also throws light on various manifestations of prostitution in the Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Syria between the mid-sixteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Get article examine le traitement de la prostitution dans plusieurs genres juridiques ottomans -manuels de droit musulman et leurs commentaires, fatwas (avis juridiques) et kânunnâmes (législation sultanienne) - et étudie la manière dont les tribunaux islamiques de l'empire et les autorités executives provinciales abordaient la prostitution dans la pratique. Cette étude de cas est aussi l'occasion d'examiner les relations qu'entretiennent divers genres de textes juridiques, ainsi que les liens unissant la théorie juridique et les pratiques judiciaires. L'article décrit enfin plusieurs formes de prostitution pratiquées dans les provinces ottomanes d'Egypte et de Syrie entre le milieu du xvi e et le milieu du xviii e siècle.},

It traces the unique convergence of Christian and Jewish messianic expectation in the 1520s that unexpectedly linked Bader to the kabbalistic prognostications of Abraham Halevi and the pseudo-military campaign of David Reuveni. Finally, it argues that Bader’s messianism was specifically crafted as a counter-hegemonic measure against the Habsburgs, whose persecution of Anabaptists such as Bader and his associates made a mockery of that dynasty’s heavy reliance on the imperial messianic ideology of the Last World Emperor.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The city’s elite families tended to operate within rival factions while trying to draw Istanbul into its internal conflicts. In this context, they formed complex relationships with the elite of Jerusalem that dominated Palestine’s politics, as well as with peasants and Bedouins in Gaza’s hinterland. The article presents the first systematic account of factional strife in Gaza during the period. In addition, it examines what caused the internal divisions in Gaza to be so severe and considers whether factionalism also played out in the urban space. It is argued that (1) the severity of this factionalism derived from the rising stakes resulting from imperial politics and economic benefits, and (2) factionalism and urban development interacted with each other, leading to a particular type of ‘spatialized factionalism’. We suggest that this perspective can lead to a better understanding of both urban politics and urban development in other towns and cities in the Ottoman Empire’s Arab provinces.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It presents and discusses evidence for the interest of Chinese Muslims and Jesuits in each other almost from the outset, immediately after Matteo Ricci s arrival in China. Muslims read Jesuit material and even incorporated it in their own works. Chinese Muslims were not, however, interested in Jesuit doctrines because of a shared monotheist faith: Chinese Muslims clearly saw Christianity not as a sister faith but as a Western one, and that was the main reason for their interest. With regard to the tendency to compare Jesuits and Chinese Muslims as two rivals competing for success in the Chinese world of ideas, the Chinese Muslim scholars should be considered not as rivals of the Jesuits but primarily as Chinese scholars engaging Jesuit knowledge and using it selectively for their own purposes. Cet essai concerne les possibilités et les limites du dialogue jésuito-islamique dans la Chine des XVI-XVII e siècles. Il présente et discute les marques de l'intérêt réciproque que se portèrent musulmans chinois et jésuites dès les premiers temps de l'arrivée de Matteo Ricci en Chine. Les musulmans lisaient les matériaux jésuites et les incorporaient même dans leurs propres travaux. Cet essai montre toutefois que les musulmans chinois ne s'intéressaient pas aux doctrines jésuites au nom d'un monothéisme partagé. À l'évidence, les musulmans chinois ne considéraient pas le christianisme comme une foi «sœur» mais, comme une foi occidentale, et c'était là la principale raison de leur intérêt. Cet essai se veut également une critique de la tendance selon laquelle Jésuites et musulmans chinois auraient été des rivaux comparables se disputant le succès dans le monde chinois des idées. Il approche les lettrés chinois musulmans non comme des rivaux des jésuites mais, avant tout, comme des lettrés chinois se confrontant au savoir jésuite et l'utilisant sélectivement à leurs propres fins.},

The Company responded by developing new legal categories and administrative language to manage these newly formed lands and thereby fashioning itself as a public agent of Calcutta’s land and landed property. Focusing on specific legal aspects of colonial hydrology that arose in the making of property in these amphibious spaces, the article argues that the soaking ecology of Bengal became a site for productive law-making by creating open-ended possibilities for taking land. It demonstrates how the Company used this new land formation to gradually institute a legal architecture regulating alluvion and dereliction and subsequently subjecting these soaking ecologies to an intricate documentary regime with the aim of disciplining the existing landed property relations in Calcutta. Documenting the haphazard extension and enactment of these new legal doctrines in a mobile landscape illuminates a particular history of the colonial regime of property and the Company-State’s early articulations of a particular type of quasi-eminent domain as a manner of taking land. Pushing a new direction in legal geography, the piece shows how the legal arena became a productive site for geographical knowledge production and legal experimentation in the colony.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It argues that the concept of condominium was among the alternatives that the Timurid authorities considered in order to formulate a novel constitutional framework for the Timurid Empire after the death of Timur, and in specific political circumstances especially in Fars, messianic and condominial principles of sovereignty conflated. To further this argument, the article focuses on one particular case, the Timurid historian Muʿīn al-Dīn Naṭanzī, who formulated the concept of condominial sovereignty, in which both Shāhrukh and Iskandar appear as equal sovereign with messianic prerogatives.

The only way in which the Mongols who by the time of Chinggis Khan numbered less than a million nomads, were able to create and rule their huge empire was by fully mobilizing the resources—both human and material—from the regions under their control. This high measure of mobility fostered robust cross-cultural exchanges in various fields, resulting in a huge expansion of knowledge and connectivity, cultural relativism, and a common imperial culture—political, material, institutional—with regional variants. These developments set the stage for major transformations in world history. The introduction presents the articles included in this special issue, which tackle various case-studies of mobility and transformation while looking at the Mongol Empire in Eurasian perspective, and highlighting the impact of the Mongols’ indigenous culture on the proto-global world of the 13th and 14th centuries.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This paper examines three historical episodes in the eleventh- to fifteenth-century history of Sri Lankan-Southeast Asian Buddhist connections attested by epigraphic and Buddhist chronicle accounts. These indicate changes in regional Buddhist monastic connectivity during the period 1000-1500, which were due to new patterns of mobility related to changing conditions of trade and to an altered political ecosystem in maritime southern Asia.},

  abstract = {This article has two basic aims. First, I discuss several notions regarding long-term changes in land-tenure arrangements, mainly in what is now Indonesia. I argue that the character of these changes is often badly understood, partly because the older literature has been misrepresented, partly because the older literature was wrong, and partly because many scholars implicitly or explicitly appear to believe in "stages theories'' (best known among scholars under the German term Stufentheorie), which posit fairly uniform and unidirectional stages of land-tenure development across the board. Second, this article deals with environmental causes and effects of long-term land-tenure developments in the Indonesian Archipelago. Land tenure and conservation are hotly debated at present, but the historical substance in such debates is meagre, usually going back no further than the 1950s or 60s. Nor does there seem to be much interest in the environmental roots of land-tenure arrangements, perhaps because the participants in the land-tenure-and-the-environment debate are mainly anthropologists and environmentalists, who might find such topics of antiquarian importance only. As an historian I cannot share this view. Cet article a deux objectifs essentiels. Il se penche tout d'abord sur quelques idées relatives à l'évolution des régimes fonciers sur le long terme, principalement dans l'Indonésie actuelle.La nature de cette évolution a souvent été mal comprise : la littérature scientifique de la période coloniale a été déformée -quand elle n'était pas dans l'erreur -, et par ailleurs nombre de chercheurs adhèrent de manière implicite ou explicite à la Stufentheorie · , qui postule l'évolution uniforme et unidirectionnelle des régimes fonciers. L'article examine dans un second temps les causes et les conséquences environnementales du développement de la propriété foncière de longue durée dans l'archipel indonésien.La propriété et la protection des terres font aujourd'hui l'objet de débats houleux, mais la matière historique citée à l'appui de ces débats est maigre et remonte rarement à la période antérieure aux années 1950 ou 1960. Les racines environnementales des régimes fonciers ne semblent pas non plus avoir suscité l'intérêt qu'elles méritent, peut-être car les participants au débat « propriété foncière et environnement » sont surtout des anthropologues et des écologistes considérant ces questions comme désuètes— vision que l'historien ne peut partager.},

Amrit Rai was as much a poet as an historian, which makes the Māncarit and the many Rajput texts like it challenging to interpret, but the possibility of gaining alternative perspectives on Mughal state formation makes such a hermeneutic enterprise essential. Bien qu'il existe un riche corpus de textes en vieil hindi (dans les dialectes rajasthani et brajbhasha) datant de la période de la première modernité, ceux-ci demeurent une archive sous-exploitée de l'histoire moghole.

First, the societies in the Arab East cannot be adequately understood without a full evaluation of their Bedouin component, especially outside urban areas. Second, studying the Bedouins can open new perspectives on important debates in Middle Eastern historiography. The paper further contends that the arid lands of the Arab East still need to be explored as a historical region with its own distinct patterns of regional connectivity and political organisation. Finally, we highlight environmental history and the study of ernie categories as promising avenues for future research on this region.},

This is demonstrated through analysis of the political relationship between the Abbasid state and the landlords, and the reasons why certain prominent Muslim jurists between 750 and ca. 900. promoted muqāsama in the Sawād of Iraq. These jurists' tax policy is explained with reference to Haldon's concept of the tributary mode of production. It is concluded that according to the jurists, muqāsama favoured a redistribution of surpluses between the state and the landowners which could strengthen relations between the Abbasid state and the powerful landlords in Iraq. Cet article propose qu'une politique fiscale ne peut être analysée qu'en lien avec le «mode de production» d'une société donnée. Cette idée est démontrée à travers l'étude des relations politiques entre l'État abbasside et les propriétaires terriens, et des raisons qui amenèrent certains juristes musulmans prééminents, entre 700 et 900, à promouvoir le système de la muqāsama dans le Sawād iraqien. La politique fiscale de ces juristes trouve une explication dans le concept de mode de production tributaire développé par Haldon. Selon les juristes, la muqāsama favorisait une redistribution des surplus entre l'État et les propriétaires terriens, ce qui permettait de renforcer les relations entre l'État abbasside et les puissants propriétaires d'Iraq.},

First, it addresses the vexed question of the generalizability of the “Western” concept of property to Indo-Islamicate land systems. Rather than beginning from the idea of ‘Islamic property law/relations’ it proposes that we reconstruct concepts relating to the control of the earth’s material substrate in terms of four modes of idiomizing land in the Islamicate tradition. In light of how the latter reconstruction suggests that (Indo-)Islamicate modes of idiomization focused on the produce of land more than land itself, the article then turns to a second issue. This concerns the similarities and differences between the deontic cultures of rights and responsibilities that characterized early modern polities (both in Mughal India and England) and nineteenth-century ones (like metropolitan Britain’s and that emerging from the East India Company’s so-called rule of property in the subcontinent).{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Dividing earlier writings—by historians and anthropologists since the 1950s—into three phases/thematics, the introduction shows how work on South Asia has long grappled with property both as a material relation and as an alien cultural category. Making the case that we must think about property’s conceptual history as being necessitated by more than just the critique of Eurocentrism, the essay clarifies how the articles that follow both continue and extend past discussion. Overall, it argues that by providing integrated perspectives on property’s material {$<$}em{$>$}and{$<$}/em{$>$} ideational dimensions, our articles will be illuminating both to scholars of Afro-Asia and those interested in law, political economy and political culture more generally.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

They have noticed the prevalence of agency relations, which followed "informal" arrangements, unlike formal partnerships, which employed written contracts. This "method" was called ṣuḥba ("companionship") in Arabic, and it entailed reciprocal exchange of favors between business "friends." Much attention has been given to what Greif calls "private order" enforcement of agency contracts, whereby merchants belonging to a "closed" consortium reported instances of cheating or opportunism by a fellow merchant, in place of enforcement by religious courts. However, economic historians relying on the Geniza documents have paid inadequate attention to evolving Jewish law in the Islamic milieu. The present article, focusing on a mercantile dispute, brings evidence to show that Jewish legal scholars adopted a feature of Islamic judicial practice to strengthen their role in enforcement of informal agency contracts. In his Code, the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides put the final touches on this accommodation by incorporating agency into the law pertaining to contract enforcement among partners.},

It examines textile manufacturing as a site in which gender, class, and ethnicity interacted to form the basis of an Armenian community before the Genocide. It brings a fresh perspective to studies on the persistence of Ottoman textile production in the age of European industrial production by approaching the community as a nexus of production relations. It argues that extensive female labor and a hierarchically organized production system under the control of merchant-entrepreneurs were among the main factors in the endurance of the Ottoman production system into World War \textsc{i}. At the same time, the control of the production system by the merchant-entrepreneurs, who were also leaders of the local Armenian community, reproduced patriarchal communal ties.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

These "barbarians from the south" (namban-jin) were considered strangers and viewed with curiosity and suspicion. In Tokugawa Japan (c. 1615-1868), politically marked by territorial unification and the centralization of power, the image of the Europeans that was created and visually registered on folding screens and lacquer-ware was used as a model to frame this presence by both the Japanese political and economic elites and those considered marginal to the existing social order. Namban art, especially paintings, can be seen as a visual display of Japan's self-knowledge and its knowledge of distant "neighbours." Lorsque les Portugais arrivèrent au Japon vers 1543, des étrangers occidentaux pénétrèrent et s'établirent à l'intérieur des frontières du pays pour la première fois dans l'histoire de l'archipel. Ces «barbares venus du sud» (namban-jin) étaient vus comme des étrangers et considérés avec curiosité et méfiance. Dans un Japon Tokugawa (v. 1615-1868) marqué politiquement par l'unification territoriale et la centralisation du pouvoir, l'image des Européens qui fut créée et traduite visuellement sur les paravents et les articles en laque fut utilisée comme un modèle pour encadrer cette présence soit par les élites politiques et économiques du Japon soit par ceux qui étaient considérés comme marginaux et exclus de l'ordre social existant. Cet article discute la façon dont l'art, en particulier les peintures, namban peut être considéré comme une manifestation visuelle du savoir du Japon sur luimême et sur ses lointains « voisins ».},

This modernity appeared only through an imbrication of raids, warfare, environmental shifts, and competing territorial claims. The violence of the territorial process, the changing geography of sovereignty, and uncertain frontier delimitation: these and other elements challenge the image of modernity arising in a fixed territory according to a linear chronology. This article argues that modernity in the Maghrib, seen through the lens of territory, is a temporally and spatially variable process: “modern” sovereign power existed only at certain levels of abstraction and within certain environmental relations. To consider modernity in the Maghrib, we will have to see how claims of sovereignty and the process of territorialization were understood by actors operating on local, regional, and imperial scales.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It investigates the production and content of {$<$}em{$>$}ʿarz-o-chehrah{$<$}/em{$>$} (muster rolls), one among many documentary genres that verified the Mughal soldier and his horse circulating on the front lines of uncertain conquest. From these materials, a previous generation of scholars distilled a taxonomy of self-contained “sub-national or ethnic” or “racial” groups (“Irani,” “Turani,” “Afghan,” “Rajput,” “Deccani,” “Indian Muslim,” and “Miscellaneous”) that confirmed narratives about the Mughal nobility found in chronicle histories. However, these modern construals of “ethnicity” remain difficult to map onto the actual ones found on descriptive rolls nor do they tell us how everyday interactions between provincial scribes and the soldier-subject transformed these categories. Social identifications underwent changes when imperial officials, scribes, and soldiers shared a war front with the armies of the regional, independent Deccan sultanates. Finer degrees of specificity characterized “northern” soldiers’ labels while “southern” cavalry were defined through broad, essentialized groupings, reflecting the changing profiles of cavalry recruitment. By analyzing social identifications, this article charts the making of a pan-subcontinent system of soldier recruitment wherein the state-making processes of northern and southern India began to mirror each other, widening the ways of defining and seeing the ‘Mughal’ soldier. This unique piece of paper bound two individual creatures, man and horse, whose identities were both separate and united, into a mutually-dependent relationship. These double portraits of man and horse functioned as proxies for pay slips and not simply as pre-modern identification cards. In doing so, they also provide a window into one instance of the uneven, ambiguous professionalization of mercenary-soldiers taking place across the early modern world.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The first claims that Jadidism was not a coherent 'movement' but reflected a set of intellectual and cultural practices closely connected with the discourse of Islamic 'reform;' the second recognizes that the association of particular individuals with Jadidism was itself contingent and sporadic, again calling into question the coherence of Jadidism in the social sphere. The third insists that previous scholarship has misconstrued the motivations and achievements of the Jadid 'reformers.' The fourth questions the interpretative value of the prevailing terminology of Jadid studies, including 'Islamic modernism' the alternative of 'traditionalism' and even 'Jadidism' itself.},

The research is based on estate inventories (terekes) and involves an analysis of the honorific titles of fathers and sons. The article demonstrates how father-son title-sharing was structured across different socio-economic groups and reveals the possible avenues of intergenerational status mobility. In addition, the article identifies temporal shifts in mobility patterns: In the late eighteenth century, intergenerational transitions linking elite title-holders and the lower echelons of the society became weaker. Also, cross-establishment transitions involving elite military and religious title-holders became less likely.},

In defining Ottoman Sunnism, state policy and state-appointed jurists and scholars played a significant role. This paper attempts to define Ottoman Sunnism in the sixteenth century in a manner subtly different from that of the jurists, by looking at the views of Ottoman historians on the issues that divided the original Muslim community, ultimately resulting in the Sunni-Shiʿi schism. Despite the seemingly sectarian conflicts of the sixteenth century, neither rigid Sunnism nor fierce confessionalization was carried over into the intellectual and cultural scene. A moderate inclination towards Shiʿism/ʿAlidism and strong attachment to Ahl al-Bayt continued to be potent forces in Sunni Ottoman intellectual circles.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The study of the economic history of Bilād al-Shām during the Mamluk period is hampered by a lack of detailed sources. This makes the Syrian historian al-Jazarī's description of the agricultural production of the Damascus and the Ghuta plain in the 14th century CE and the organization of tax collections there all the more interesting. The present paper attempts to examine the variety of agricultural production in the greater Damascus area and to analyze the role of agriculture in its economic system. It does so also by focusing on the close connections between the city of Damascus and its hinterland at the end of the Middle Ages.},

The most influential formulator of the Ottoman eschatological identity was the mystic and lettrist ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Bisṭāmī, whose works underlie the fully articulated royal messianism of Sultan Süleymān (r. 1520-1566). At Süleymān’s court the French orientalist and apocalyptic enthusiast Guillaume Postel, a proponent of French Valois universal end-time monarchy, saw al-Bisṭāmī’s work brandished in 1535. Following the trajectory of the production, consumption, and deployment of these texts in the context of revolutionary changes across the Mediterranean—not least of all in understandings of religions and their relationship to historical empire—makes clear the centrality of apocalyptic to contemporary understandings of history and the significance (and legitimacy) of the new imperial formations, and to new understandings of the interrelationship between cognate, if sometimes hostile, monotheisms.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Moving between the southern and western frontiers of Iraq, the Amärät have seldom been the focus of historical enquiry, but their attempts to navigate the disturbed interwar landscape offer a window onto the changing prospects for Bedouin groups across the Arab East. Building on a close reading of colonial sources, the article reveals how important social, economic, and political dynamics of Bedouin life persisted to shape relations within the new mandates, as the ʿAmārāt, their sheikh, and the young colonial state all jostled for influence and authority.},

The main sources for this framework have been the political writings of the Jadids, Islamic reformists and modernists who later became engaged the mass-movement politics, beginning in 1905 and continuing through the Russian civil war and the first decade of Soviet power. A central feature of the Jadid narrative, which has carried over into the historiography, has been that Muslim society, particularly in Russia's Volga-Ural region, was facing a crisis brought about by the supposed failure of its traditional Islamic institutions in the face of a modernizing Russia.

Other areas of historical contact between Russia and European countries and China and Asian countries have been mapped out by extensive research.

Aimed at resolving the tensions that resulted from the interplay between local customs, Islamic law, and the Italian legal codes, such a recourse to jurisprudence was a dear departure from Italy's own codebased legal system. This judicial innovation was also a change from the practices introduced in British and French colonies, where the codification of a hybrid European-local law had become the norm. Divided into three parts—jurisprudence as source of law in Italy, its uses in the colonies, and jurisprudence in practice (through the analysis of the sentences on shuf'a, the customary right of pre-emption)—this article illustrates Italian jurisprudencial law in Libya as an example of the theoretical problems and practical advantages of legal pluralism in a colonial context. Cet article examine comment les autorités italiennes ont introduit la jurisprudence émanant de la Cour d'appel en tant que source de droit en Libye de 1911 à 1943. Destiné à résoudre les tensions qui ont résulté de l'interaction entre les coutumes locales, le droit islamique et les codes juridiques italiennes, un tel recours à la jurisprudence était clairement une rupture avec le système basé sur les codes juridiques en usage en Italie.

  abstract = {The Bahrāmī Safavids, a relatively unknown collateral branch of the Safavid dynasty, active in Iran from 1517 to 1593, played a crucial role in dynastic developments in Safavid Iran. This essay examines the dynastic developments of the Safavid rulers and their contemporaries to argue that they embarked on a process of dynastic centralization, presenting themselves increasingly as the only holder of dynastic power, at the expense of their male relatives. The persistence of the Bahrāmī branch illuminates how this process took shape in Iran and how dynastic developments among neighbouring Central Asian dynasties influenced the fate of the Safavid collaterals.},

In order to carry out their plans, these Moriscos sought assistance from the French king Henry \textsc{iv} (r. 1589-1610). Analyzing a Morisco letter remitted to Henry \textsc{iv} and multiple archival sources, this article argues that prophecy served as a diplomatic language through which Moriscos communicated with the most powerful Mediterranean rulers of their time. A ‘connected histories’ approach to the study of Morisco political activity underscores the ubiquity of prophecies and apocalyptic expectations in the social life and political culture of the early modern Mediterranean. As a language of diplomacy, apocalyptic discourse allowed for minor actors such as the Moriscos to engage in politics in a language that was deemed mutually intelligible, and thus capable of transcending confessional boundaries.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Prevailing interpretations tie this social turmoil to the region's sudden integration into the modern world economy, further aggravated by state reforms that upset long-standing political hierarchies. This paper argues that the origins of these disturbances lay not in the penetration of the modern world economy but in the extended political crisis that shook the Ottoman Empire during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Sectarian tensions therefore need to be seen, at their root, as political reactions to the slow disintegration of the early-modern political order. In its timing and causes, this Ottoman experience helps to highlight a broader "sectarian turn" that overtook many other parts of Eurasia in the same period.},

This retrospective exhibits the practical difficulties that make it unlikely that the Mughals ever fully implemented their program.

This article explores these local geographical writings through theories on identity and space, arguing that these texts reflect the shifting spatial imagination of Persianate elites in the context of rapid social and economic change. These texts are an alternate entry point for viewing the politics of identity in Qājār Iran, challenging the teleological approach to the emergence of nationalism in secondary literature. Taking the close relationship between territory and community as a starting point, this article argues that expressions of regional socio-economic unities, which are a key feature of the geographical writings of Iranian elites, reflect the consolidation of regional identities.},

Based on a study of property documents and court papers, the essay argues that property was not simply an index of wealth, but a medium through which social relations were affirmed, reproduced and contested. Owing to the identification of property with the honor of families and caste groups, transactions in property were socially regulated activities that bore the imprint of local power relations. Property documents were imbued with a plethora of meanings, and this was because the scribal-literate tradition in Mughal India co-existed with an oral-performative culture. Writing was used by social actors in a wide variety of ways, and for different sets of objectives, sometimes to reinforce the social order, on other occasions to disrupt it.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This article takes a new and critical look at the formative years of the Muṭarrifiyya, questioning the assumption that it started with a theological dispute and rather arguing that there was already a form of "proto-Muṭarrifiyya" around the year 1000, existing as a loosely organised network of intellectuals engaging in common rituals, study circles, practices of hospitality and the collection and redistribution of zakāt.},

Although the practice of disputation in the majlis (assembly) was no longer present in the Ottoman Empire, Catholic missionaries in the Middle East continued to write fictional dialogues in the seventeenth century. The authors we discuss here were convinced that it was possible to debate with Muslims, provided that the right type of interlocutor was chosen from among distinguished and educated men, with whom they shared a code of conduct and certain religious and intellectual concerns. This attitude may be the result of the typical Jesuit method of accommodatio and of their fieldwork experience in the Orient. Nevertheless, this positive approach was impeded by the impossibility that a Catholic priest could escape the culture of disputation and consider Islam as an ordinary subject of study. Le genre littéraire du dialogue entre chrétiens et musulmans remonte aux premiers siècles de l'Islam. Bien que le majlis de controverse ne se pratiquât plus dans l'empire ottoman au XVII e siècle, les missionnaires catholiques du Proche-Orient continuèrent à écrire des dialogues fictifs. Les auteurs évoqués ici sont convaincus qu'il est possible de discuter avec les musulmans, à condition de choisir le bon interlocuteur, parmi les hommes distingués et instruits, avec lesquels ils partagent un code de conduite et des préoccupations intellectuelles ou religieuses. Cette attitude pourrait être rapportée à l'expérience des missionnaires sur le terrain, et à la méthode jésuite de Y accommodatio. Néanmoins, cette approche positive de l'Islam est constamment contrariée par l'impossibilité pour un prêtre catholique d'échapper à la culture de controverse, et de considérer l'islam comme un sujet d'étude ordinaire.},

These two most decisive factors transformed not only the economic life of the region but brought about a new era of political economy. Sustained minting of high-quality silver coinage and regular supply of war-horses for maintaining a strong cavalry formed two fundamental tasks for the Sultanate regime particularly in view of the fact that both the items i.e. raw silver and horses were not indigenous and the rulers were wholly depended on import. The primary goal of the paper is to reflect on the silver inflow and outflow into and from Bengal region through 13th to 16th centuries and correlate this with the expenditure faced by the Bengal Sultans on the maintenance of cavalry.},

I argue that colonial interventions—namely, the hybrid adjudication of murders, the newly designed system of self-government, and the imposition of an arbitrary land-rights regime—correlated in unexpected ways and triggered instigated and staged murders and false accusations of murder as an extreme recourse in defence of landuse rights. I conclude by relating the particular legal setting of Russian colonial rule to its representation as "the time of dishonour." Dans cet article j'essaie d'élucider les fausses accusations de meurtre, les meurtres prémédités et les meurtres simulés attestés parmi les Kirghiz du Tian Shan à l'époque colonial. A cette fin, j'analyse des récits ethno-historiques, les lois statutaires coloniales et les écrits des ethnographes coloniaux. Je soutiens que des interventions coloniales, telles le jugement hybride des meurtres, le système d'auto-gouvernance nouvellement introduit et la gestion ambiguë de la terre, se combinent de façon inattendue pour produire les meurtres bizarres comme ultime remède aux injustices terriennes. Dans les conclusions, je relie l'environnement légal de la domination coloniale à sa représentation comme "le temps de déshonneur."},

To understand better these largely misunderstood historical problems related to migration and settlement, the essay casts doubt on the utility of geographers' tripartite division of the Ganga plain, proposing instead a division based on aridity and rainfall. Such a division helps explain why the transitional zone between the drier and the more humid areas of the Ganga plain became the linchpin of migratory movements, state formation, and urban development since at least the middle of the first millennium BCE.},

I analyse the terminology used for identifying Jewish litigants at the Islamic court in Edirne based on 12 cases selected from the Islamic court registers. In other words, I scrutinize in which cases the court identified Jews by their membership of a particular congregation (Heb. {$<$}em{$>$}kahal{$<$}/em{$>$}; pl. {$<$}em{$>$}kehalim{$<$}/em{$>$}), in which cases by their residential affiliations (Ott. {$<$}em{$>$}mahalle{$<$}/em{$>$}; pl. {$<$}em{$>$}mahallat{$<$}/em{$>$}, “urban quarter”), and in which by a combination of these aforementioned ascriptions. In so doing, I attempt to enhance our understanding about pre-modern people who were simultaneously members of multiple religious, spatial, ethnic or occupational sub-communities. More specifically, I examine which of the Jews’ multiple identities (i.e., {$<$}em{$>$}kahal{$<$}/em{$>$} as religious/ethnic; {$<$}em{$>$}mahalle{$<$}/em{$>$} as spatial) were emphasized by the judges of the Muslim courts. I suggest that various identification markers were employed by court personnel to define the Edirne Jews.

  abstract = {This article examines the salience of space and emotions in histories of Rampur, the last Muslim-ruled princely state in the colonial United Provinces in British India. It addresses, in particular, the categories of space and subjectivity by exploring place identity (Rāmpūr/Rampūrī) and the sentiment of belonging to Rampur (Rāmpūrīyat), which convey emotional attachment of the self to space. Emotional identification and sense of place also influence spatial practices. There is a shifting relationship between space and the way inhabitants relate it to their identity (or identities), which can be analyzed historically to understand how space and emotions are socially constructed and accrue further meanings. I examine a history of emotions by exploring a literary "space of imagination" where love of and attachment to Rampur are articulated and experienced. The paper focuses on local-history writing in Urdu to map the historical and emotional aspects of identifications with Rampur. Its local histories are marked by emotions of pride, love, nostalgia, and practices of memory, remembrance, and forgetting, all of which produce its "emotional geography." Literariness, or a self-consciously literary sensibility, limns Rampur with meaning and qualities, particularly through descriptions of its geography and environment and the qualities of its inhabitants that connect the place with its people. The paper situates in history these shared emotions and their transformation, especially amid changes during the colonial period, the Partition of British India, and the integration of the princely state of Rampur into the post-colonial Indian nation state.},

We examine the existing theoretical and conceptual models on the relations between space and emotions and illustrate how scholars need to bring together narratives, materiality, and practices in order to understand the entanglement of space and emotions. Through four different but connected historical examples: Mughal imperial Delhi, princely Rampur, small towns milieux in colonial India and the Lyari neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, we trace the shifting configurations of power, emotions, and social space of "Muslim locales" in South Asia. On this particular terrain, we also want to specify the nature of change in emotional experiences as Muslim locales transformed from elite enclaves into locales of disempowerment in the transition to national independence. We examine the shifting discourses and practices in the built environment, in the landscapes portrayed in visual and literary reconstructions, and in the lived everyday spatial practices and experiences in South Asia. While providing a historical narrative, these articles also present new possibilities to explore affective archives and interdisciplinary approaches for writing a history of emotions.},

Unsurprisingly, the only person who fulfills these requirements, according to the historian, is Ahmad Shah. While this is standard practice in most Persianate and Islamic histories about a king, the text deviates from a number of other literary conventions. The historian deemphasizes Ahmad Shah’s genealogy and connection to Sufi saints; instead, he focuses on Ahmad Shah’s inner piety and morality by attributing to him the concept of {$<$}em{$>$}ilhām{$<$}/em{$>$} (direct revelation from God)—an attribute more generally characteristic of prophets and saints, not kings. The double move of deemphasizing lineage and Sufi connection while privileging personal, God-bestowed attributes is sharpened through comparison: Mughal governors and emperors are depicted by the author as descendants of noble, dynastic genealogies, but govern incompetently because they do not have the clarity of vision and fate of victory on their side, as God has not bestowed them with {$<$}em{$>$}ilhām{$<$}/em{$>$}.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The changing pattern of land ownership and control is studied in detail in one specific village in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam.Several practices of land use and land distribution are discussed, as are various efforts in parts of Vietnam to expand agricultural land, in particular near rivers and coasts, especially as a result of land reclamation. The study of marginal lands is focused on alluvial lands, which were seen originally as empty or waste lands but gradually developed into safety nets for the poor. The traditional social function of these communal waste lands, managed by village elites, was eroded and became a tool for manipulation in the hands of state and village authorities. Cet article traite des aspects des registres fonciers dans le Vietnam pré-colonial et colonial et leurs relations avec la situation actuelle des terres dites marginales depuis le XI e siècle et surtout depuis le début du XIX e siècle. L'évolution de la propriété foncière et de contrôle est étudiée en détail dans un village en particulier dans le delta du fleuve Rouge au nord du Vietnam (avant et durant l'époque coloniale). Plusieurs pratiques d'utilisation des terres et la distribution des terres communales sont présentées. L'article présente aussi divers efforts dans plusieurs régions du Vietnam de développer des terres agricoles, en particulier près des rivières et des zones côtières, notamment en raison des travaux de poldérisation. La question des terres marginales se concentre sur les terres alluviales qui étaient à l'origine considérées comme des terres vides ou des déchets, mais peu à peu développées comme des soupapes de sûreté pour les pauvres. La fonction sociale traditionnelle de ces terres communales, gérées par les élites du village, est érodée et devenue un outil de manipulation entre les mains des gens de pouvoir de l'état et le village.},

In the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Ponnāni was the only place where the Dutch East India Company had commercial access into the kingdom of the Zamorins of Calicut. When the Dutch gained prominence in the coastal belt, this port town became the main centre for their commercial, diplomatic, and political transactions. But as a religious centre it began to recede into oblivion in the larger Indian Ocean and Islamic scholarly networks. The present article examines this dual process and suggests important reasons for the transformations. It argues that the port town became crucial for diplomatic and economic interests of the Dutch East India Company and the Zamorins, whereas its Muslim population became more parochial as they engaged with themselves than with the larger socio-political and scholarly networks.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It serves as an introduction to four case studies exploring social, communal and political boundaries in different Ottoman cities from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century. Our understanding of boundaries rests on a theoretical approach that considers urban space as a collection of socially constructed territories whose boundaries have important functions that serve to structure urban life. From a long-term perspective boundaries can also serve as a heuristic tool to examine the transition from the Ottoman to the post-Ottoman period and its effects on urban environments. In conclusion, the article explores in how far Ottoman urban boundaries in their various transformations can explain present-day urban situations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

By scrutinizing administrative distinctions between "nomadic" and "semi-sedentary tribes", or "Bedouin" and "Shawaya" adopted during the Mandate, the article explores how notions of social order, which were partly informed by stereotypical imaginations of the Bedouin, have shaped local politics and influenced social dynamics in northern Syria. The article also traces how the experiences of the Mandate years resonate in articulations of social and political identity in Syria around the beginning of the twenty-first century. Taking inspiration from Judith Butler's exposition of the performative constitution of gender identities, it is suggested that the constitution of tribal identities in Syria, too, can productively be regarded as a performative process.},

  abstract = {Contemporary Bedouin-related publications about tribal groups reveal a persistent interest in lineages. This article places this phenomenon within the larger framework of Bedouin self-representation and explores the nature and specific uses of the complex and polysemie notion of nasab in treatises and speech. The ambiguity resulting from a tension between the pragmatic context of local articulation and circumstantial (re-) definition and the ideological significance, purportedly unchangeable and defined character and moral value of nasab is reflected in historical and modern discourses as well as in pervasive references to tribal groups as being defined by nasab. The particular concomitance of practical and ideological aspects is the reason for the lasting impact of this notion, as its structure allows for the negotiation of both political issues and individual and collective identities. The publications considered here, mostly from Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, vary between an affirmative stance that often seeks to define prestigious lineages and an attempt to balance the obvious uncertainties of the data with an interest in establishing the identity of tribal groups and narratives referring to descent. As Bedouin lore puts it, the concept of belonging defined by origins in terms of agnatic descent (nasab) is challenged, and sometimes superseded, by the affinity established through locality and cohabitation.},

An account of the night-time sessions presided over by Emperor Jahāngīr from 1608 to 1611, this source highlights the Mughals' will to assert their power on a Eurasian scale and the central role played by Iran, Central Asia, and Hindustan in the elaboration of imperial ideology and identity.

The paper then investigates the lived experience of mutilation, encompassing both physiological and social impairments. Finally, a ‘supra-practical’ aspect is proposed, considering the esoteric connotations of mutilation, this latter understood as a set of practices including but not confined to actual physical dismemberment.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The evidence suggests that India developed a sophisticated concept of landed property from earliest history, with conceptual tools and legal instruments to define the rights of owners vis-à-vis rulers, rival claimants, and holders of subordinate interests (such as tenants, cultivators, mortgagees, etc.). It further shows that although earlier inscriptions deployed those tools and instruments in a narrow range of transfers between rulers and Brahmins or other religious groups, subsequent periods provide evidence of an increasingly wider application, including gifts by non-elite donors, ordinary contractual land transfers, and resolution of property disputes. In some cases, the implication seems to be that the legal framework was more widespread in practice but generated durable records (in metal or stone) only for elite actors; in many cases, it seems likely that elite legal resources became more widely available over time. This survey also notes how documents bring to the fore aspects of property law—the role of councils and arbitrators in administering the law (rather than the king or his officers), or the use of documents to carve out special rights—that are less prominent in scholastic treatments such as Dharmaśāstra.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The city was burned and looted and its monumental temple complexes, gateways, and images left in ruins. Despite large-scale damage to architecture in the city, however, the level and focus of destruction was strikingly variable. In this paper, we draw on the material record of late Vijayanagara temple complexes and other archaeological evidence to examine patterns of differentially distributed political violence. We suggest that these patterns may be understood, in part, in terms of the contemporary politics of sovereignty, incorporation, and reconstitution of elite authority. Drawing on these observations, we discuss the role of commemorative destruction as well as post-1565 temple rededications and abandonments in the afterlife of Vijayanagara as a social space. In particular, we examine the potential of monumental violence to act as a symbol or to index social memory through a creative and fluid process of instituting claims about the past, heritage, authenticity, and the nature of the present.},

Al-Ṭabarī's historical analysis considers state policy on land tax, and religion as a legal norm related to the social contract between the head of state and the landlords. It is concluded that al-Ṭabarī saw the misāḥa tax system and 'rule of law' as the principal conditions for imperial rule, and that al-Ṭabarī's History already provides an answer to modern historians' questions as to why the Abbasid state crumbled, and what role religion played in the political economy. Cet article avance que l'Histoire des prophètes et des rois d'al-Tabarī analyse le déclin de l'État abbasside conformément à la théorie économique du «cavalier seul». Al-Ṭabarī considère que la politique fiscale de l'État, tout comme la religion en tant que norme juridique, sont liées au contrat social conclu entre le sommet de l'État et les propriétaires terriens. Aux yeux d'al-Tabarī, le système fiscal de la misāḥa et l'«État de droit» apparaissent comme des conditions essentielles à la survie du pouvoir impérial. L'Histoire d'al-Ṭabarī offre ainsi une réponse aux historiens modernes qui se demandent pourquoi l'État abbasside finit par se désagréger et quel rôle la religion put jouer dans l'économie politique.},

The relatively low price of black pepper indicates that Indo-Roman trade goods was not just pitched at the very wealthy, but benefited a much broader segment of the population. This throws new light on the scale and cultural impact of Indo-Roman trade, which appears to have exploited Rome’s burgeoning non-elite “consumer culture” in the early imperial period. The scale and cultural impact of Indo-Roman pepper and other trade is evidenced by a wide variety of Western sources and ancient Indian texts.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Nor have they often allowed us to recover an historical account of the making of modernity as a global condition, beyond the largely dichotomous or bifurcating categories introduced by modern relations of power and unequal exchange themselves. As an introduction to this collection of articles, this essay sketches what I call a “tectonic” approach to modernity as an historical process, with the aim of recapturing the dynamics by which, between the late eighteenth century and the mid-nineteenth, differently located people and places came to occupy divergent positions both in socioeconomic and political structures and in narratives of “modern” history.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However sophisticated their weapons and other technology, until at least the 1880s European colonial armies were forced to rely exclusively on baggage animals if they wanted to move around: railways arrived very late in the history of European expansion. In Central Asia this meant rounding up, loading, managing and feeding tens of thousands of camels, which could only be furnished by the pastoral groups who inhabited the region, who in some cases were also the objects of conquest. Camel transport placed certain structural constraints on European conquest in Central Asia: firstly it meant that the forces involved were almost always very small; secondly it prevented the launching of spontaneous or unauthorised campaigns by "men on the spot," as every advance had to be preceded by the rounding up of the necessary baggage animals, and the creation of a budget to pay for then. Finally, the constraints imposed by camel transport ensured that British and Russian armies would never meet in Central Asia, and that a Russian invasion of India was a chimera.},

In particular, this paper pinpoints how and why it was that the Yellow River shifted from a long-term condition of relative stability to a later state of frequent floods and course changes in the eleventh century. It is possible to trace the environmental history of this dramatic and sudden change of state with precision and confidence. Historical sources that record the dates and characteristics of flood events downstream align well with those that note the locations and dates of human activity upstream. More important, each aligns well not only with one another, but also with information from environmental science: sediment cores that preserve soil and pollen evidence for the timing and processes of systematic change.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It is suggested that, while the rebels, most of whom were peasants, acted collectively for national causes, many of them also perceived personal economic and rural collective interests in participating and acted to pursue economic and national goals simultaneously. This analysis helps explain why peasants comprised the main rebel force, why many of them were “landless” and from the poorest stratum of Palestinian rural society, why militias tended to be small, why banditry became dominant in 1938, and how economic motivations fueled an internal Arab-Palestinian civil war.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

These waqfs (charitable foundations) had large agricultural holdings, and their financial developments consequently reflect the local agricultural conditions in central Anatolia. This analysis of the waqf account books deals with the short-term financial difficulties resulting from harvest failures and increasing grain prices. The widespread Celâlî rebellions seem to have caused agricultural crisis and the financial decline of waqfs in the early seventeenth century. Dans cet article, nous examinons l'histoire financière de trois waqfs (ceux de Mevlânâ Celâleddîn-i Rûmî, de Sadreddîn-i Konevî et de Selîm II), à Konya, en nous appuyant sur des registres comptables de la fin du xvi e et du début du xvii e siècle. Ces waqfs (fondations pieuses) possédaient de vastes domaines fonciers et leurs développements financiers reflètent ainsi les réalités agricoles de l'Anatolie centrale. Les livres de comptes de ces waqfs viennent mettre en lumière des difficultés financières à court terme, liées à de mauvaises récoltes et à la hausse du prix des céréales. Les révoltes Celâlî semblent avoir entraîné une crise agricole ainsi que le déclin financier des waqfs au début du xvii e siècle.},

Throughout these decades, as the Saudi regime repeatedly claimed that paper currency violated Islamic orthodoxy because it was a bearer of interest, these scholars argued forcefully for the medium’s legitimacy by mobilizing the legal sources of their particular school of law ({$<$}em{$>$}madhhab{$<$}/em{$>$}). This contrast reflects how the religious politics of the kingdom departed from both Ottoman precedents and other contemporary Islamic contexts in which paper currency was widely assimilated via the assent of Muslim legal scholars. The regime’s tepid support for, or outright obstruction of, the creation of formal banking facilities that issued paper currency further exacerbated this divergence. In the end, because of such inconsistency it required technocratic institutions like the \textsc{IMF} and \textsc{ARAMCO} to introduce paper currency and a formal banking system into the kingdom from the mid-1950s.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Recurrent episodes of severe drought and cold dramatically affected these groups, who were unable to withstand extreme changes in temperature and precipitation. Back-to-back drought episodes created a shortage of water, dried up pastures and damaged forage, while severe cold resulted in high rates of premature death among herd animals.

While the new Bolshevik ideology provided an ideal justification to enact the State-centric, technocratic principles implicit in the Tsarist Turkestan “water law” of 1916, it took a very long time for the Soviet regime to produce a comprehensive legislation that would explicitly replace the local pre-existing customs which had survived in the colonial period. This is surprising especially in the light of the continuity in personnel in the government agencies that governed land and water resources across the 1917 revolution. Two possible reasons for this slowness were the early Soviet “decolonisation” imperative and the inertial persuasion that the legislator could not fully grasp the intricacies of water-related rights and duties.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It explores the caravan trade’s economic and political dimensions from the Gulf to Syria. This trade’s resurgence was simultaneous with the reassertion of imperial control over the steppe. In that changing context, the institutionalization of caravan trade by groups such as the ʿAqīl traders kept overland trade lively and arguably competitive.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Mixed courts were an internationally staffed bench that represented the diplomatic alliances between capitulary powers and the Egyptian government. Decisions delivered by these courts were based on the so-called "mixed codes," which provided parties to a dispute with substantial scope for legal maneuvering. On the basis of a case study concerning a mortgage on a waqf (charitable endowment), I shall explain how legal actors, in spite of the state strong presence as regulatory agent, took advantage of the loopholes in the mixedcourt system. Far from being an obstacle in the quest of justice, legal vagueness became an opportunity for anyone able to expand his own legal horizons beyond the limits imposed by the colonial rule. Les Tribunaux Mixtes étaient des tribunaux internationaux résultat de la coopération entre les puissances capitulaires et le gouvernement Egyptien. Les jugements étaient basés sur les « codes mixtes », des codes crées expressément pour servir dans le tribunaux mixtes, toutefois les nombreuses lacunes des codes laissaient la place a des manœuvres juridiques à la fois audacieuses et peu orthodoxes. Sur la base d'un cas d'étude concernant un waqf et une hypothèque je démontrerai comment les acteurs légaux, en dépit de l'action régulatrice de l'état, profitaient des lacunes présentes dans les codes mixtes. L'imprécision des codes en fait se traduisait en opportunité pour tous les acteurs légaux capables d'agrandir les limitations des horizons juridiques fixés par le gouvernement colonial.},

By comparing the different power relations between Cossacks and the local population on the Ural River and in the Aral Sea region, it shows how they shaped fisheries management regulations and their effectiveness. It also investigates the conditions of production of scientific knowledge on the Aral Sea ecosystem and what role it played in governance decision-making. By drafting a series of fishing regulations and by examining the balance between humans and aquatic animals, scientists oriented the Tsarist government’s decisions on how to manage both the fisheries and the populations that exploited them. At the same time, members of a specific social group, the exiled Ural Cossacks, functioned as mediators between the imperial state and an ecosystem undergoing colonization.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

There is no question that the fundamental concerns of an “archival turn” are every bit as relevant to studies of Islamic societies, past and present, as they are to European-dominated ones. Yet investigating Islamic “archives” presents the challenge of coming to terms with a concept—the archive—and an attending set of assumptions and theoretical baggage derived almost exclusively from European history. To address this challenge, we propose that employing the term “cultures of documentation” offers a way of having one’s cake and eating it too. In deploying this expression, we signal that there existed multitudes of textual practices and record-keeping activities in the pre-industrial Islamic world, and that it is possible to move away from “archive” as a term without abandoning the core insights and questions of the historical literature built around it.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Drawing on the engineering experience of the villagers, water allocation and management in the gravity-fed canals of the Fayyum were in the hands of iqtd holders and tribal groups along the main canals, a pattern similar to that which pertained in mediaeval al-Andalus. Grâce à une série de sources exceptionnelles, le vaste système d'irrigation du Fayoum, en Moyenne-Egypte, peut être reconstitué depuis l'Antiquité jusqu'à l'ère islamique. L'examen approfondi d'un relevé cadastral de cette province, datant de 641/1243-4, montre que l'époque islamique se caractérise par une gestion locale de l'approvisionnement en eau. S'appuyant sur l'expérience technique des villageois, les détenteurs iïiqtâ's et les groupes tribaux implantés le long des principaux canaux du Fayoum contrôlaient la répartition de l'eau et la gestion des canaux alimentés par gravitation. Ce modèle de gestion de l'eau rappelle à bien des égards les pratiques en usage au Moyen Âge en al-Andalus.},

In particular, it explores the implications of Robert Hayden’s model of “antagonistic tolerance” for Ottoman urban history. In a first step, by taking into consideration the urban form of Niš from a long-term historical perspective, we consider how urban space was divided between inhabitants with different religious backgrounds. The article then turns to consider the symbolic boundaries that existed between confessional groups in nineteenth-century Niš, which can be traced by looking at the construction of churches and mosques. By examining the ways in which communal boundaries were expressed, negotiated and changed through church and mosque buildings, we can begin to render the confessional policies of the Ottoman authorities more transparent.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

During the 14th and early 15th centuries, the Ming court of China tried to shape the memory of the Mongol empire to enhance Ming political legitimacy, dampen hopes of a Mongolian revival, and facilitate the transfer of allegiance from the Mongol empire to Ming dynasty. The Ming court also integrated former Yuan personnel, including not just Chinese subjects but hundreds of thousands of Mongols and Jurchens, into the Ming polity. In examining these processes, the essay contributes to the wider discussion of how successor polities throughout Eurasia sought to turn the legacy of the Mongol empire to their own advantage, which had the unintended consequence of keeping memory of the Chinggisid age vital long after the empire’s fall.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The essay considers the differences among a lay popular version of these disputations offered by Fernáo Mendes Pinto, the account publicized by Francis Xavier in his letters to Europe, and the internal working documents produced by his companions Cosme de Torres and Juan Fernández during these encounters. The latter reflected the complexity of the exchanges that took place in Yamaguchi in September 1551, offering many echoes of Buddhist arguments that stretched the Christian theological capacity. More interesting still is the process by which the Jesuits came to reject the possibilities for convergence through analogy and chose instead to emphasize doctrinal and moral differences, often employing arguments that echoed, unwittingly, the recent divisions within European Christendom. À partir des récits des disputations qui opposèrent François Xavier et ses compagnons à différents moines bouddhistes durant les premières années de la mission au Japon (1549-51), cet article se livre à une exploration contextuelle du dialogue comme forme d'interaction transculturelle. Cet essai met à jour les différences entre la version populaire et laïque de ces disputations offerte par Fernáo Mendes Pinto, le récit diffusé par François Xavier dans ses lettres destinées à l'Europe et les documents de travail internes produits durant les rencontres par ses compagnons Cosme de Torres et Juan Fernández. Ces derniers reflètent la complexité des échanges qui eurent lieu à Yamaguchi en septembre 1551 et donnent à entendre les échos des arguments bouddhistes qui poussèrent les limites de la théologie chrétienne. Ce qui est plus intéressant, cependant, c'est le processus qui conduisit les Jésuites à rejeter les possibilités d'une convergence via l'analogie et à mettre plutôt l'accent sur les différences doctrinales et morales en recourant souvent à des arguments qui faisaient involontairement écho aux récentes divisions internes à la chrétienté européenne.},

This paper departs from the common approaches to the rebellion, which have focused on the persona of Sheikh Bedreddin and the impact of his heterodox formulation of Islam.

We counter this claim and demonstrate how local self-sufficiency was replaced by specialized economies beginning in Iron Age IIB. 2) Contrary to past assumptions, we argue that changes in animal-husbandry strategies were dictated by historical factors rather than by environmental ones. The main shift in livestock husbandry reflects enhanced social complexity during a period of transformation in the territorial-political system from local kingdoms to imperial rule.},

In 1670, the same reform had been implemented in Crete and the Aegean. Some observations concerning the distribution of the taxpayers into the three classes raise the question of how these latter were defined; it seems that no legal definition was used and that taxpayers declared at will their economic situation. Furthermore, a close study of the implementation of the reform in Crete shows that the government underwent a long process of negotiation and compromise, proposing alternative forms of maktu (lump sum) collection and fixed percentages. En 1691 le gouvernement ottoman remplaça le système de collection de cizye par foyer et en tarife uniforme, en imposant une catégorisation tripartite des contribuables en riches, hommes de condition moyenne et pauvres ; la même réforme fut expérimentée en 1670 à Crète et aux îles de l'Archipel. On observe quelques particularités dans la distribution des contribuables aux trois classes, ce qui nous fait demander quels étaient les critères de cette distribution. Or, il paraît qu'il n'y avait pas des tels critères légaux dans les textes concernant la réforme. En plus, cette dernière ne fut pas appliquée avec rigueur; l'exemple de Crète montre un long procès de négociation et de compromis, utilisant soit le système forfaitaire (maktu), soit des proportions fixées dans la distribution des contribuables.},

Looking, as they were, for an instance oi qāḍī malpractice, the Russians sought recourse to legal concepts borrowed from sharīa and fabricated evidence as they saw fit. I draw on the idea of legal pluralism in order to highlight how, in Russian Central Asia, legal praxis inevitably embraced diverse conceptions of legality. I also show how locals were able to maneuver government officials into using procedures from various legal traditions and thus produce a legal hybrid. Le présent article s'attache à reconstituer un contentieux touchant la légitimité d'un waqf établi à Tashkent en 1881. Le litige opposait un qāḍī aux héritiers du fondateur de la dotation; les autorités coloniales russes étaient en charge de l'enquête. Prompts à mettre en cause les qāḍī pour malversations à la moindre occasion, les Russes n'hésitaient pas à recourir à des notions juridiques empruntées à la sharia, voire à forger des preuves au besoin. Mon analyse de cette affaire s'appuie sur la notion de pluralisme juridique, qui permet de mettre en évidence la coexistence, dans la justice telle qu'elle se pratiquait en Asie Centrale sous domination russe, de conceptions hétérogènes de la légalité. Cette étude révèle aussi le rôle des populations locales, et leur capacité à induire les fonctionnaires d'état à mettre en œuvre des procédures émanant de traditions différentes, au point de produire de véritables hybrides juridiques.},

Little has been done so far to analyze the output of Muslim scholars ({$<$}em{$>$}ʿulamāʾ{$<$}/em{$>$}) operating under Soviet rule from the perspective of earlier Islamic intellectual traditions. The present essay addresses this problem and sheds light on manifestations of continuity among Islamic intellectual practices—mostly puritanical—from the period immediately before the October Revolution to the 1950s. Such a continuity, we argue, profoundly informed the activity of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (\textsc{SADUM}) established in Tashkent in 1943 and, more specifically, the latter’s attack against manifestations of religiosity deemed “popular,” which were connected to the cult of saints. Thus, this essay posits that the juristic output of Soviet {$<$}em{$>$}ʻulamā’{$<$}/em{$>$} in Central Asia originates from and further develops an Islamic reformist thinking, which manifested itself in the region in the late 19th- and early 20th-century. By establishing such an intellectual genealogy, we seek in this article to revise a historiographical narrative which has hitherto tended to decouple scripturalist sensibilities from Islamic reformism and modernism.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This ended with Russian colonization. Conflict resolution was left to the Sharῑ͑ a courts; mediation continued to be important but state appointees were no longer officially involved in bringing it about. The Russian colonial and Soviet administrations made the community responsible for seeking amicable settlements.

Dans l'Asie centrale de l'époque moderne, en revanche, des fonctionnaires nommés par la chancellerie servaient de médiateurs et les procédures de médiation correspondaient à une intervention de l'État dans la résolution des conflits. La colonisation russe mit fin à cette pratique. La résolution des conflits fut désormais laissée aux tribunaux religieux. La médiation demeurait importante, mais les fonctionnaires d'État n'y jouaient plus de rôle officiel. Les administrations coloniales russe puis soviétique chargèrent la communauté de trouver elle-même des solutions amiables aux conflits qui la divisaient.

I suggest that Jadidism has a historical meaning but one that differs from what historians have so far conferred upon it.

  abstract = {This essay aims to provide some analytical foundations for the study of legal pluralism in Muslim-majority colonies. Specifically, we contend that the incorporation of Islamic law into the colonial legal systems should be distinguished from the process of integration and codification of oral customs. As Islamic law constitutes a well-established legal system, based on written traditions and on elaborate institutions of learning and adjudication, its incorporation into the colonial legal system carried with it a number of implications. These are discussed, as are the tripartite relations that often emerge in Muslim-majority colonies between statutory laws, Islamic, and customary laws ('ādat, 'urf). The final section of the essay aims to present the articles included in this special issue and to place them within this broad context. Le présent article vise à établir des fondements théoriques à l'étude du pluralisme juridique dans les colonies à majorité musulmane. Il insiste en particulier sur la nécessité qu'il y a à distinguer l'incorporation de la loi islamique aux systèmes juridiques coloniaux, du processus d'intégration et de codification du droit coutumier non écrit. La loi islamique constitue un système bien établi, fondé sur des traditions écrites et pourvu d'institutions de formation et d'exercice complexes. Son incorporation au sein du système juridique colonial a entraîné un certain nombre de conséquences spécifiques, qui sont analysées ici. Une attention particulière est en outre accordée aux relations triangulaires qui se font jour entre loi statutaire, loi islamique et droit coutumier ('ādat, 'urf) dans les colonies à majorité musulmane. Enfin, la dernière partie est consacrée à la présentation des articles réunis dans le numéro spécial dédié à ces enjeux.},

During this era of imperial reforms, discourses around education increasingly focused on the importance of female education. This article uses census material from Tripoli in today’s Lebanon to explore the experiences of students in the wake of these shifts. It examines literacy rates across different social and religious groups and the extent to which educational decisions parents made were biased by gender and class. The analysis reveals that the rate of Muslim boys’ literacy was high even before new schools opened starting in the 1850s. As for the post-reform developments, it shows that although around a quarter of propertied families decided to send their sons and daughters to school, a considerable proportion of Muslim and Christian families privileged sons alone. Still, reforms allowed a number of groups in the generations between 1860 and 1910 to achieve higher rates of literacy, including Muslim and Christian girls as well as the children of artisans.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

I address the ways in which the document circulated beyond the imperial offices and how the Franciscans transformed it through strategies including storing, marking, interpreting, cataloging, and silencing. The paper sheds light on the convergence between the deployment of the Ottoman documents and the rise of the Franciscan authority, indicating how Franciscan usage of the archive produced useful narratives beyond the confines and control of the Empire.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Shatzmiller's examinations of the role of Islamic institutions in periods of economic growth show that economic growth was visible in the key indicators of the Caliphate's economy between ca. 750 and ca. 1100. The conclusion is that there was nothing intrinsic to Islamic institutions that impaired economic growth. Un intérêt grandissant pour la théorie économique des institutions et pour le rôle de ces dernières dans la croissance économique a récemment modifié la méthodologie des historiens spécialistes de l'Islam. Les recherches empiriques ont été de plus en plus délaissées au profit de modèles théoriques favorisant les généralisations à l'emporte-pièce sur le rôle négatif joué par l'État islamique et les institutions juridiques. Examinant le rôle des institutions islamiques en période de croissance, Shatzmiller montre que les indicateurs clés de l'économie califale témoignent d'une croissance économique entre 750 et 1100 environ. Il faut en conclure que rien dans les institutions islamiques n'entravait intrinsèquement la croissance économique.},

Instead, I suggest that entitlements be schematized according to how regularized the right was, whether it was permanent, and how duty-bound the right holder was. In this formulation, revenue farm refers to a complex of rights and duties secured by contract in which a sovereign transferred the temporary exploitation of a holding for rent in advance. It was one of four tenurial complexes under which entitlements fell, the others being estates from bureaucratic assignment, hereditary occupation or possession by grant/gift, and tributary or chieftaincy.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Beginning in the late 1950s, Qūrṣāwī's Irshād li-l-ʿibād was put forward by Tatar academics seeking to support the narrative as the specific source of his views on ijtihād. The discussion of ijtihād in this text does not, however, conform to the Jadids' conception of it, and the attempts to locate Jadidist ideals in it rely on highly anachronistic and specious interpretations. Based on the study of the relevant Soviet historiography and its sources, I argue that this narrative is not supported by the works of Qūrṣāwī or Marjānī but comes ultimately from Jadidist writings from the 1920s.},

Le présent article se penche sur un long conflit, relatif à la propriété de terres situées près du confluent du Nil, qui suscita la production d'une série de documents officiels. Deux procèsverbaux exceptionnels du début du XIX e siècle montrent notamment comment le droit d'asile put être invoqué par le représentant de la partie perdante.},

This paper re-examines the nature and limits of South Asian kingship by investigating the modes in which Man Singh Kachhwaha, a prominent regional chief in the Mughal Empire, claimed royal status. I examine how target audiences—consisting of literati, peers, rivals, and the Mughal overlord—may have received an ambitious chiefs claims to kingly status in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. This essay reinterprets the abundant evidence from Man Singh's reign to reveal the character of kingship in South Asia as much more circumscribed and contingent than has often been assumed, and as continually open to challenge and contestation.},

Surjan's surrender of Ranthambhor fort was celebrated in Mughal chronicles such as the Akbarnama but condemned in Nainsi's Khyat and other Rajput texts. Drawing primarily on Surjanacarita, a Sanskrit poem from about 1590, this article examines the literary strategies that were employed to justify Surjans submission to Akbar and his subsequent career as a Mughal mansabdar (imperial rankholder). Cet article explore une facette sombre du dialogue culturel—l'expérience de la soumission à un «Autre» culturel—à travers l'étude du cas de Rao Surjan de Bundi, un guerrier rajput qui fut vaincu par l'empereur moghol Akbar en 1569. La reddition de la forteresse de Ranthambhor à l'initiative de Surjan fut un objet de célébration dans les chroniques mogholes telles que l'Akbar Nama, au contraire du Khyat de Nainsi et d'autres textes rajputs qui la condamnèrent. S'appuyant essentiellement sur le Surjancarita, un poème sanskrit datant d'environ 1590, cet article examine les stratégies littéraires employées pour justifier la soumission de Surjan à Akbar et sa carrière ultérieure en tant que mansabdar (dignitaire) moghol.},

As the state granted its sources of revenue to timariots in return for military service, it was financially relieved of the need to pay the expenses of the cavalry. Several documents so far neglected by scholars and evidencing the practice of cash loans to timariots during military campaigns prove otherwise. This paper analyzes the process of the generation of timariots' disposable income in the framework of actor-network theory. It is argued that the granting of loans demonstrated an attempt to regulate the cash flow of the timariot's income during campaigns, which was necessitated by problems of transforming tax revenues into disposable form. In the light of documents evidencing cash loans, it is further argued that cash loans reflect the vulnerability of the Ottoman timar system.},

If one examines servility as an aggregate phenomenon, these subjects can be investigated on a much larger scale with quantitative approaches. Using servile populations as a point of departure, this paper applies both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore Babylonian population dynamics in general; especially morbidity, mortality, and ages at which Babylonians experienced important life events. As such, it can be added to the handful of publications that have sought basic demographic data in the cuneiform record, and therefore has value to those scholars who are also interested in migration and settlement. It suggests that the origins of servile systems in Babylonia can be explained with the Nieboer-Domar hypothesis, which proposes that large-scale systems of bondage will arise in regions with plentiful land but few workers. Once established, these systems persisted and were reinforced through Babylonia’s high balance mortality, political ideologies, economic incentives, and social structures.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In pre-modern times, land ideally could be inherited, but this could be overruled by the king. Taking and exploiting a piece of land meant that the owner would be registered and taxed. In the Chaophraya Delta, where waterways were the dominant means of water transport, two separate types of housing developed: the house-boat and houses on rafts. The latter form of high-density living on the water was only abandoned in the second half of the nineteenth century.Finally, the question of occupying land is looked at from the perspective of the commoner. Depuis des temps immémoriaux jusqu'au décret du 7 avril 1861, toute terre appartenait au roi thaï. Cet article s'interroge sur la signification pratique de cette règle dans la longue durée. Si à l'époque pré-moderne les terres pouvaient théoriquement être héritées, le roi pouvait annuler de telles successions. Pour un propriétaire, défricher et exploiter une terre signifiait être enregistré et soumis à imposition. Dans le delta du Chao Phraya, où le transport fluvial prédominait, deux formes d'habitat distinctes se développèrent : le bateau-maison et les maisons sur radeaux. Ce dernier type d'habitation à forte densité d'occupants ne disparut que dans la seconde moitié du XIX e siècle. L'occupation de la terre est en dernier lieu abordée à travers le regard du petit peuple.},

Identification of these people allows a better understanding of the recruitment of Egyptian judiciary staff. Their reputations as scholars, as well as their ethnical, geographical and tribal origins, show that legal careers were limited by social barriers for a long time. Up until the 3rd/9th century, the office of scribe was mostly held by mawālī — high-ranking clients could possibly aspire to the office of investigator—, whereas qāḍīs were recruited among Arabs. The partitioning of the judiciary reveals a complex social hierarchy beyond the mere distinction between Arabs and non-Arabs. The results of this study also allow a re-evaluation of the Abbasid revolution s impact on Egyptian society. Cet article entreprend dans un premier temps de reconstituer des listes de scribes (kātibs) et d'enquêteurs judiciaires (ṣāḥibs al-masā̓il) actifs à Fusṭāṭ entre le I er /début VIII e et le IV e /X e siècle. L'identification de ces personnages permet, dans un second temps, de mieux comprendre le recrutement du personnel judiciaire égyptien. Leur réputation en tant que savants, ainsi que leur origine ethnique, géographique et tribale, montrent que la carrière judiciaire fut longtemps limitée par des barrières sociales. Jusqu'au III e /IX e siècle, les fonctions de scribe revinrent le plus souvent à des mawālī, les plus élevés d'entre eux pouvant éventuellement briguer le poste d'enquêteur, tandis que les cadis étaient arabes. Le cloisonnement de la judicature révèle ainsi une hiérarchie sociale complexe, allant au-delà de la distinction entre Arabes et non-Arabes. Les résultats de cette étude permettent accessoirement de réévaluer l'impact de la révolution abbasside sur la société égyptienne.},

It is these documents that this article analyses.

Nonetheless, such cross-cultural connections feature only sporadically in Persian chronicles, and Brahmans rarely elaborated on their imperial links in Sanskrit texts. In this essay I analyze a major exception to the Brahmanical silence on their Mughal connections, the Kavīndracandrodaya ("Moonrise of Kavīndra"). More than seventy Brahmans penned the poetry and prose of this Sanskrit work that celebrates Kavīndrācārya's successful attempt to persuade Emperor Shah Jahan to rescind taxes on Hindu pilgrims to Benares and Prayag (Allahabad). I argue that the Kavīndracandrodaya constituted an act of selective remembrance in the Sanskrit tradition of cross-cultural encounters in Mughal India. This enshrined memory was, however, hardly a uniform vision. The work's many authors demonstrate the limits and points of contestation among early moderns regarding how to formulate social and historical commentaries in Sanskrit on imperial relations.},

It argues that the guarantee of religious privileges, which prepared a new set of terminology—that is, "privileges," "religion," and "politics"—for discussing the scope of the jurisdiction to be granted to the non-Muslims' religious authorities, represented a shift in how the empire approached non-Muslims. Muslim officials aimed to circumscribe the jurisdiction of non-Muslims and place them under the state's control by emphasizing the "religiousness" of the privileges. To do so, they also displayed a decided tendency to bypass the religious authority by using lay non-Muslim elites as intermediaries. The Armenian elites, for their part, strategically chose their attitudes toward the distinction of "religious" and "nonreligious" (or "political"), thus managing to protect, to a certain extent, the scope of the religious authority's jurisdiction.},

These numbers in turn have parallels in Western Central Asia, where oasis sizes can also be calculated by examination of preserved archaeological landscapes and oasis walls. It is therefore possible to reach a rough idea of the populations dwelling in the main oases and valleys of sedentary Central Asia. As regards nomadic regions, the data are far more hypothetical, but references in certain sources to the sizes of nomad armies and rates of nomadic military levying can allow us to calculate at least the possible scales of magnitude for populations living to the north of the Tianshan.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This approach rejects the notion that high infant mortality rates result in widespread parental indifference to infant loss, arguing instead that underlying biological and transcultural realities inform human responses to this phenomenon. With this conclusion in mind, a review of ancient Mesopotamian archaeological evidence reveals patterns of differential infant burial; while the interpretation of these patterns is uncertain, the broader contexts of infant burials in ancient Mesopotamia do not point to parental indifference, but rather the opposite. The available textual evidence in turn indicates that ancient Mesopotamians valued their infants, sought actively to protect them from harm, and mourned deeply when they died, a conclusion that is not controverted by evidence of infant exposure.},

This stimulated market exchange, associated with growing monetization of the economy, especially in the towns, but also in the countryside, even though coercion remained more pronounced there. We hypothesize that these developments brought economic dynamism but simultaneously increased inequality and furthered the rise of new, powerful elite groups, causing the decline of the same markets.},

These texts suggest that the land market was restricted by the legal rights of king and temple. There is little information on wage labour. Slave labour existed, but neither its role in the economy nor the importance of the slave trade has been adequately assessed. The use of credit, interest, cheques, and other financial instruments is attested, but its significance is small, not least because of the prevalence of iconic interest rates of 20\%, set by tradition rather than by market forces. As far as the evidence goes, the markets for land, labour, and capital were restricted by tradition and by the claims of king and temples on land, while the commodity markets were much more market-oriented.},

The photograph was taken after a Hindu religious ceremony in honour of the Italian Sanskritist Angelo de Gubernatis. Dressed as a Hindu Brahman, he is the only European photographed next to three Indian scholars, but what the image suggests of encounter and hybridity was challenged by the many written texts that reveal the conflicting dialogues that took place before and after the portrait was taken. Several factors were examined in order to decide who should and who should not be in the photograph: religion, cast, and even gender were successively discussed, before the category of "knowledge" became the bond that unified the four men who studied, taught, and wrote on India. En analysant l'histoire d'une photographie prise dans un studio photographique de Bombay en 1885, cet article explore les notions de production du savoir sur l'Inde, de dialogues, rencontres, appropriations et conflits culturels dans le contexte de l'Inde coloniale britannique de la fin du XIX e siècle. La photographie fut prise à l'issue d'une cérémonie religieuse hindoue en l'honneur du sanskritiste italien Angelo de Gubernatis. Habillé en brahmane hindou, il est le seul Européen photographié aux côtés de trois érudits indiens. L'idée de rencontre et d'hybridité suggérée par l'image est toutefois remise en cause par les nombreux textes écrits révélant les dialogues conflictuels qui eurent lieu avant et après la réalisation du portrait. Un certain nombre de facteurs furent examinés pour décider qui devrait et qui ne devrait pas figurer sur la photographie: la religion, la caste et même le sexe furent successivement discutés avant que la catégorie du «savoir» s'impose comme le lien unificateur des quatre hommes qui étudiaient, enseignaient et écrivaient sur l'Inde.},

The Minangkabau in West Sumatra are an interesting example of legal pluralism in Muslim societies. Their adat (indigenous law and social organisation) of matrilineal heritage regulated kinship, group affiliation, inheritance of property, and succession to office. Since the sixteenth century they have been devout Muslims. Their history is characterised by dynamic transformations of the relationship between adat and Islam, and—since their incorporation into the colony of the Dutch East Indies in the early nineteenth century—with the state. The paper shows how these conflicts and negotiations produced different results in different arenas. The agreements reached in the political arena were usually different from the use of law in the decision-making processes of village and state courts, as were the actual practices of villagers in everyday property and inheritance affairs. Cet article traite des luttes ayant porté sur les lois relatives à l'héritage dans le Sumatra occidental à l'époque coloniale. Les Minangkabau du Sumatra occidental (alors inclus dans Indes néerlandaises) sont un exemple intéressant de pluralisme juridique. Leur droit coutumier (adat) à tradition matrilinéaire régit les relations de parenté, les principes d'appartenance aux groupes de descendance ainsi que l'héritage des biens et des charges politiques. Depuis le 16 ème siècle les Minangkabau sont des musulmans fervents. Leur histoire est caractérisée par une dynamique de transformations dans la relation entre adat et Islam, et depuis leur incorporation dans la colonie des Indes orientales néerlandaises au 19 ème siècle aussi avec l'état. Les conflits et négociations afférant à la relation entre systèmes de droit ont été menés dans diverses arènes et de diverses façons. Les accords conclus dans l'arène politique ont eu peu de répercussions sur le type de droit utilisé dans les processus décisionnels des tribunaux villageois et étatiques.},

However, the cessation of minting by the Ming dynasty in the 1430s provoked a monetary crisis. Private coinage proliferated both in China and abroad, creating a profusion of heterogeneous transactional currencies and numerous regional monetary circuits. This paper examines monetary circulation in maritime East Asia—encompassing China, Japan, Ryukyu, Vietnam, and Java—during the fifteenthseventeenth centuries in order to re-assess the impact of Chinese coin in fostering monetary integration (and disintegration).},

It focuses on the continuing influence of what I call the “decline narrative” on both national historiographies and Western specialist studies. Elaborated in the context of French colonialism and consecrated by nationalist-cum-reformist discourses, the denunciation of the centuries preceding colonial conquest as an epoch of decadence has hardly been challenged. Beginning with the French historian and sociologist Jacques Berque (1910-95), however, there was a vivid interest amongst social scientists in early modern Islamic culture. The main part of the paper will be dedicated to a methodological analysis of some of these works, and, in the concluding section, I will discuss the degree to which the study of the diffusion of Islamic literacy in rural areas may serve as a starting point for a renewed approach to Islamic literature and its social foundations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This was a dual movement, of spontaneous participation and organized recruitment by local committees. The volunteers were ideologically heterogeneous, some having had no previous political career. The decentralized nature of the mobilization and the regionally differing socioeconomic compositions of the volunteers suggest that regionally diverse trajectories of nationalism movements coexisted in Tunisia. Understanding this volunteer movement from the bottom up, focusing particularly on the socioeconomic conditions that made the mobilization possible, can help us understand the dynamism of nationalism as a social movement.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

After 1908, when the instigators of the revolution and their supporters climbed up the social and political hierarchies, the mustache rose with them and became the facial ornament of the most powerful people in the empire.

  abstract = {The contention of this article is that some cultural emphases shift in response to changing socio-economic realities, in order to serve specific socio-economic interests. This paper examines, through the prism of the cultural activities and ideologies of some Beiruti merchants, their contribution to the process of the Arabic nahḍa, enlarging on their conceptual endowment to the process of modernization. The paper sheds new light on several aspects of the merchants' cultural contribution by emphasizing the strong link they forged between culture and economy, focusing on the merchants' activities and writings, especially those of Salîm Bustrus, here presented as a case study. Nous proposons dans cet article que certains choix culturels apparaissent en réponse aux changements socio-économiques et afin de servir des intérêts spécifiques. La contribution de marchands beyrouthins à la nahḍa arabe - et notamment leur apport conceptuel au processus de modernisation - est examinée à travers le prisme de leurs activités culturelles et de leur pensée. Cet article apporte un éclairage nouveau sur plusieurs aspects de l'apport culturel des marchands, en soulignant les liens durables qu'ils surent tisser entre la culture et l'économie. Les activités et les écrits de ces marchands sont analysés, tout particulièrement ceux de Salïm Bustrus, qui font ici l'objet d'une étude de cas.},

By reading lived experience across genres that often contained elements of one another, this article places interconnected Mughal lives as central to textual renderings of the past.},

It tripled from the 1860s-80s and then retreated to approximately the level of the 1840s by the 1930s-40s. The sharp fluctuation was caused mainly by changes in population and household economic structure, as agricultural yields changed little. Development of the industrial and urban economy partially offset declining income in sericulture in the 1920s-40s by employing rural laborers, but raising the net income per capita to the late-nineteenth-century level would have required the threefold growth of the Jiangnan industrial and urban economy, which was unlikely.},

Based on legends and typology, most of these issues can be attributed to the Ghaznavid period. This new numismatic evidence calls into question long-standing narratives of the Ghaznavid invasion of Hindustan, which posit that the Ghaznavids pursued a uniformly iconoclastic policy toward Hindu sacred sites. The evidence also suggests that the Ghaznavids embraced diverse modes of interaction with the Hindustani frontier zones. These went beyond the well documented raiding expeditions to realize short-term financial gains. Rather, the Ghaznavids may also have had long-term economic objectives, which necessitated preserving existing sacred institutions and their administrative and fiscal machinery and patronage networks.},

  abstract = {In this article I look into a Jesuit dialogical and catechetical text—a confession manual—published in Tamil in 1580. Written as instructions for Tamil Catholics and for Jesuit confessors, these kinds of texts were nodal points in which Tamils and missionaries reprocessed their knowledge of each other and established rules for appropriate social interaction and Catholic sociability. My claim is that the Confessionairo captured and condensed Tamil voices and arguments in a network of Jesuit normative vocabulary and offered a language of self-knowledge expressed in affective vocabulary. A confession manual should not be considered only a strategy for missionary manipulation but also an important tool for the social self-empowerment of the new convert. Dans cet article, j'examine un texte jésuite tout à la fois dialogique et catéchétique - un manuel de confession - rédigé en tamoul en 1580. Recueils d'instructions à l'usage des catholiques tamouls et des confesseurs jésuites, ces textes constituèrent des points nodaux pour la transformation du savoir que les tamouls et les missionnaires avaient les uns des autres et pour l'établissement de règles garantissant des rapports sociaux et une sociabilité sans heurts. Je montre dans cet article comment le Confessionairo captura et condensa des voix et des «arguments» tamouls dans les interstices d'une structure et d'un vocabulaire normatif jésuite, créant du même coup un langage du savoir sur soi à travers un vocabulaire affectif. Suivant cette perspective, le manuel de confession ne doit pas être réduit à une stratégie de manipulation missionnaire : il est aussi un instrument qui permit au nouveau converti d'affirmer leurs nouvelles identités comme une sorte de pouvoir social.},

Until recently, however, historiography has been dominated by the British experience from the nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, with Kew Gardens at the center of the "green imperialism." In this article we address the hard-won knowledge acquired by those who participated in early modern Portuguese imperial bioprospecting in Asia. The Portuguese were the first to transplant important economic plants from one continent to another, on their imposing colonial chessboard. In spite of this, the history of Portuguese bioprospecting is still fragmentary, especially with respect to India and the Indian Ocean. We argue not only that the Portuguese—imperial officials, missionaries, and the people connected with them, all living and working under the banner of the Portuguese empire—were interested in gathering knowledge but also that the results of their endeavors were relevant for the development of natural history in the early modern period and that they were important actors within the larger community of naturalists.},

This paper reviews the history of cotton textile production in the Jiangnan region (or Lower Yangzi River area) where it thrived from 1300 to 1830, and discusses the factors contributing to its commercialization. It reveals the impact of the Ming and Qing governments in its institutionalization, and how the social organization of the industry was framed around the household economy and women's labor. This essay also documents the problems that cotton production and marketing encountered by the end of the eighteenth century, and demonstrates how the recent debates about the 'great divergence' and the nature of the Chinese political economy resonate in the history of China's cotton textile enterprise. Finally, it shows how in the first decades of the nineteenth century, empire-wide demographic and environmental constraints brought economic stasis to Jiangnan's cotton industry.},
